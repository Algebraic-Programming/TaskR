 * This class defines the basic execution unit managed by TaskR.

 *
 * The function represents the entire lifetime of the task. That is, a task executes a single function, the one provided by the user, and will reach a terminated state after the function is fully executed.
 *
 * A task may be suspended before the function is fully executed. This is either by voluntary yielding, or by reaching an synchronous operation that prompts it to suspend. These two suspension reasons will result in different states.
